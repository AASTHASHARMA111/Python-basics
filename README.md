# Python-basics
What is Python?
Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.

And while you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's Flying Circus.

At the height of its success, the Monty Python team were performing their sketches to live audiences across the world, including at the Hollywood Bowl.

Since Monty Python is considered one of the two fundamental nutrients to a programmer (the other being pizza), Python's creator named the language in honor of the TV show.

# Python goals
In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:

an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
code that is as understandable as plain English;
suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.

# Why Python?

There are many reasons – 

it's easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster;
it's easy to teach - the teaching workload is smaller than that needed by other languages; this means that the teacher can put more emphasis on general (language-independent) programming techniques, not wasting energy on exotic tricks, strange exceptions and incomprehensible rules;
it's easy to use for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;
it's easy to understand - it's also often easier to understand someone else's code faster if it is written in Python;
it's easy to obtain, install and deploy - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.

# Starting your work with Python

To start your work, you need the following tools:
•	an editor which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
•	a console in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;
•	a tool named a debugger, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.
